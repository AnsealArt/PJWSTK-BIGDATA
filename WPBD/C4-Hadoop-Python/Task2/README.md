## About
This script takes any file, splits it into letters and counts them, then prints in descending order. Computation is done using Hadoop Distributed File System (simulation mode).

## Steps
1. Run Hadoop Services:
```/usr/local/hadoop/sbin/start-all.sh```

2. Run script:
```./run.sh```

If doesn't run, need to add permissions:
```chmod 755 ./run.sh```
